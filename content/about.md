Hi, I'm ngaihte.

Welcome to my blog. I plan to share the knowledge and insights that I have gained during my continuous journey of navigating the vast expanse of technology. Every thing I post is my own opinion and should be taken with a grain of salt.

#### Badges I have acquired

I am a student of computer science with a passion for hacking, devops and cloud. On this blog, I will be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights on all things computer science, with a focus on hacking, cybersecurity, devops principles and the cloud.

As a student, I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with all of you. Whether you are a fellow student of computer science or just have an interest in the field, I hope that you will find something of value here.

So join me on this journey as we delve into the exciting world of computer technology and hacking together!
